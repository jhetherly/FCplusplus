<title>FC++ Changes since last version</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>
This document summarizes the changes since the previous release of the
FC++ library.  (As always, see the 
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/">FC++ web site</a> for 
the latest.)
</p>

<h1>Changes from v1.4 to v1.5</h1>

The library has a number of <b>improvements</b> and <b>additions</b>:
<ul>

<li><b>Lambda</b>.  FC++ now supports <code>lambda</code>, so you can
create anonymous functions on-the-fly.  FC++'s lambda has a tiny
functional sublanguage with features like 
<code>letrec</code>, <code>do</code>-notation for <a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New1.5/lambda.html#monad">monads</a>,
and comprehensions.  See "<a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New1.5/lambda.html">FC++
Lambda</a>" for more details.</li>

<li><b>Infix syntax</b>.  FC++ functoids now support infix syntax, so
instead of saying "<code>f(x,y)</code>" you can also say "<code>x ^f^
y</code>".  See "<a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New1.5/infix.html">New infix
syntax</a>" for details.</li>

<li><b>Smart functoids</b>.  Functoids now "know" how many arguments
they expect, which makes it possible to implement some useful and
general combinators.</li>

<li><b>Full functoids</b>.  The <code>FullN</code> wrappers add all the
extra FC++ functoid functionality (currying, lambda-awareness,
smartness, infix syntax) to existing functoids.  See "<a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New1.5/full.html">Full
functoids</a>" for details.</li>

<li>There are a number of new functoids, including <code>funify</code>,
<code>of</code>, <code>thunkFuncToFunc</code>, <code>hCurry</code>,
<code>hUncurry</code>, <code>delete_</code>,
<code>outStream</code>, and <code>inStream</code>.
(<code>operator.h</code> and <code>prelude.h</code>)</li>

<li>The new features required a number of new header files; the new header
description is <a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New/header_dependencies.html">here</a>.</li>

<li>More C++ compilers are supported, see the <a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New/compilers.html">compilers
page</a> for details.</li>

<li>The distribution of client examples now has an index describing the
more interesting clients.</li>

</ul>

The library also has a number of <b>bug fixes</b> and <b>small changes</b>:
<ul>

<li><code>ptr_to_fun</code> is now a functoid</li>

<li>When <code>ptr_to_fun</code> is used on an instance method, the
resulting functoid can now accept a smart pointer (e.g.
<code>Ref</code>) as the first (receiver) argument</li>

<li>Some of the combinators in <code>prelude.h</code> (like
<code>ignore</code>) now work properly, regardless of the arity of the
functoids passed in as an argument, thanks to "smartness".</li>

<li>The <code>Ref</code> and <code>IRef</code> classes now have
<code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>; this fixes minor
bugs that can arise from implicit conversions to pointers.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Changes from v1.3.1 to v1.4</h1>

The library has a number of <b>improvements</b> and <b>additions</b>:
<ul>
<li>Added support for the Intel 6.0 compiler (with thanks to Terje 
Slettebo, who did the testing on this compiler).</li>
<li>Changed the List implementation to conform to the proposed
resolution of C++ Core Language Issue 270:
<a href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html">"Order 
of initialization of static data members of class templates"</a>.  <br>
<font size="-6">
(This change could potentially make the library run less efficiently if
your compiler does not optimize function static data well.  As a result,
the old List implementation is still available via the compiler flag
<code>FCPP_1_3_LIST_IMPL</code>.  The old implementation technically has
order-of-initialization (OOI) bugs which may cause programs to coredump, 
but in practice, these are easy to work around.  If you are using FC++
in a setting where you need very high performance but are having trouble
getting the old implementation working without crashes, email Brian and
he'll show you how to get your code working fast.)</font>
</li>
<li>A number of new (non-Haskell) utility functoids have been added to
prelude.h:  <code>id</code>, <code>noOp</code>, <code>before</code>,
<code>after</code>, <code>uncurry</code>, <code>duplicate</code>,
<code>ignore</code>, <code>constructN</code> and <code>newN</code>.
Also, the <code>Maybe</code> type from Haskell has been added.</li>
<li>Added functoids for <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
(list.h).</li>
<li>Added functoids for <code>dereference</code> and <code>addressOf</code>
(operator.h).</li>
<li>Monomorphic unary/binary functoids are now implicitly also STL
functors (e.g. they define <code>F::result_type</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Tweaked the <code>Sig</code> structures in a way that enables a new class of
combinators to be written (<code>compose</code>, <code>before</code>,
<code>after</code>, and <code>uncurry</code> can
discover whether or not their arguments are zero-arg functoids, and can
act accordingly).  Now rather than referring to <code>F::Sig::ResultType</code> for a
zero-arg functoid of type <code>F</code>, you should refer to
<code>F::Sig&lt;&gt;::ResultType</code> or just
<code>RT&lt;F&gt;::ResultType</code> instead.</li>
<li>The flag <code>FCPP_DEFER_DEFINITIONS</code> will prevent the .h
files from creating definitions of the library functoids; the
declarations remain, but you must separately compile
<code>definitions.cc</code> and link it in.  This is useful for
applications using FC++ in multiple translation units--it prevents each
TU from having its own (redundant) copy of each of the library functoid
objects in favor of a single "master" copy.</li>
</ul>

The library also has a number of <b>bug fixes</b> and <b>small changes</b>:
<ul>
<li>Added <code>ptr_to_fun</code> overloads for const member functions.</li>
<li>Fixed minor type-system bugs in <code>binder1and2of2</code>,
<code>stlN</code>, and <code>cat</code>.</li>
<li>Made curry binders store <code>const</code> data members.</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>Compose0</code>, as <code>Compose</code> now 
subsumes it.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>flip</code> so it returns a curryable result.</li>
<li>Fixed a number of the prelude functions (like <code>length</code>)
so that they don't complain if you pass them an <code>OddList</code> 
instead of a <code>List</code>.</li>
<li>Gave names <code>const_</code>, <code>and_</code>, and
<code>or_</code> to corresponding functoids.
Whenever a functoid's name clashes with a C++ keyword, we add a trailing
underscore.</li>
</ul>

Finally, we have a new email discussion list, see the
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/">FC++ web site</a> for 
details about how to subscribe.

<h1>Changes from v1.3 to v1.3.1</h1>
<h6>Note: v1.3.1 was only released for the XR library.</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a small bug in the template version of <code>enumFrom()</code></li>
<li>Added copy constructor and assignment operator code to the
<code>FunN</code> classes (shouldn't be necessary, but without it,
exposes a compiler bug on at least one platform) </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Changes from v1.2.1 to v1.3</h1>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The run-time performance of the library has been drastically improved.
This has all been done "under the hood"; the interface to the library
has barely changed.  The main sources for the improvements are
<ul>
<li>intrusive reference counting</li>
<li>new implementation of <code>List</code>s</li>
<li>new techniques for "reusing" functoids in the prelude implementation</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The library now works with both g++2.95.2 and g++3.0.  It should also
work with any other standard-conforming C++ compiler.  See
<a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New/compilers.html">this
page</a> for details.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There are now many more example files.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>New additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Fun3</code> class has finally been implemented.  Like
<code>Fun2</code> it supports automatic currying.</li>

<li>Class <code>IRef</code> (the intrusive version of
<code>Ref</code>) has been added.</li>

<li><code>ListIterator</code> now supports
<code>operator-&gt;</code>.</li>

<li>The flag <code>FCPP_DEBUG</code> turns on extra run-time checking
so that if you try to <code>head()</code> or <code>tail()</code> an
empty list, an exception (of type <code>fcpp_exception</code>) is
thrown.  Without the flag, there is no run-time check (and the code
fails un-gracefully).</li>

<li>The flag <code>FCPP_SAFE_LIST</code> adds a destructor to the
<code>List</code> class which ensures that list nodes are destroyed
iteratively.  The reference-counting in list nodes
(<code>Cache</code>s) works recursively, and as a result, can blow the
stack for large lists.  In other words,
<pre>
   {
      List&lt;int&gt; l = enumFromTo(1,200000);
      length(l);   // force evaluation of the list (actually create nodes)
   }  // Boom!  Recursion with a call-depth of 200000.
</pre>
is likely to "blow up" unless the <code>FCPP_SAFE_LIST</code> flag is
set.  Setting this flag degrades the overall performance of lists,
however.  In order to ensure that a <em>specific instance</em> of a
list doesn't blow up, you can always just iteratively destroy that
list, as in
<pre>
   {
      List&lt;int&gt; l = enumFromTo(1,200000);
      length(l);   // force evaluation of the list (actually create nodes)
      while(l) l = tail(l);   // iteratively destroys list
   }  // no problem here
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The library no longer has a
<pre>
using namespace fcpp;
</pre>
at the end of <code>prelude.h</code>.  As a result, you should add this
yourself to your <code>.cc</code> files that use the library.
</li>

<li>The signature of <code>cat</code> has changed slightly.  The first
parameter must be a list, but the second parameter can be either a list
or a function that returns a list.  (It used to be that both parameters
could be either lists or functions.)</li>

<li>Due to the new list implementation, the signatures of many of the
functions in the prelude have changed.  However, this should break very
little client code.  See <a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/New/new_list_implementation.html">this
page</a> for details.</li>

<li>The <code>Sig</code>s of <code>Plus</code>, <code>Minus</code>,
etc., now better reflect the true signatures of those functoids.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Removals</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>OneElement</code> (<code>one_element</code>) has been removed.
You should use <code>cons(x,NIL)</code> instead.</li>

<li><code>Nil&lt;T&gt;</code> has been removed.  You should just use NIL
instead, unless type inference fails, in which case you can always use
<code>List&lt;T&gt;()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Obscure flags</h2>

<ul>

<li>The flag <code>FCPP_LEAK</code> turns off the reference counting in
the <code>IRef</code> class.  As a result, the application leaks
away memory (but might run faster).</li>

<li>The flag <code>FCPP_TEMPLATE_ENUM</code> makes <code>enumFrom()</code> and
<code>enumFromTo()</code> be template functoids rather than just
functoids that work on <code>int</code>s.  They really probably should be
template functoids, however g++2.95.2 seems to generate slow code for
them when they templated, for no obvious reason.  (g++3 generates fast
code regardless of whether the functoids are templated or not.)</li>

<li>The flag <code>FCPP_OOI_DEBUG</code> turns on some debugging output for the
creation of global objects (that may be initialized before
<code>main()</code>).  This helped us debug order-of-initialization
errors.</li>

<li>The prelude functions are written with performance in mind, using
<code>OddList</code>s, <code>Reuser</code>s, and iteration.  The old
implementations of many of the functions are still there, enclosed in
<code>#ifdef FCPP_SIMPLE_LIST</code>s.  We've kept the old
implementations in the file mostly for instructional value (they
illustrate the simplest ways to create functoids, and also help show
the changes necessary to create optimized versions of functoids).</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Changes from v1.2 to v1.2.1</h1>

<p>
The library now compiles with the "-pedantic -ansi" options for g++,
which means it will probably compile with more other compilers now, too.
The previous release had a number of "typename" problems; C++ requires
the "typename" keyword to appear in lots of places inside templates.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Changes from v1.1 to v1.2</h1>

<h2>New additions</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Automatic currying</b>.  Now (practically) all functoids are
curryable by default.  For example, 
<pre>
   minus(3,2);   // yields 1
   minus(3);     // yields a new function f, where f(x) = 3-x
   minus(3,_);   // same as above
   minus(_,2);   // yields a new function f, where f(x) = x-2
</pre>
This is accomplished by the <code>CurryableN</code> classes, which
serve as wrappers around normal functions.  The function
<code>makeCurryable()</code> turns an uncurryable function into an
automatically curryable version.  See <a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/currying.html">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/currying.html</a>
for more info.</li>

<li><b>Namespaces</b>.  Now the library is in namespace
<code>fcpp</code>.  However, bugs in the g++2.95.2 compiler force us to keep
part of the library in the global namespace.  If you have a working
compiler, use the compiler option -DFCPP_USE_NAMESPACE to have the whole 
library be in the namespace.  There's a 
<pre>
   using namespace fcpp;
</pre> 
at the bottom of <code>prelude.h</code>, which dumps it all
into the global namespace anyway.  We've done that for backwards
compatibility (you can drop in the new library and your old code should
still work without changes), but feel free to remove it (we certainly
will, in a future revision).</li>

<li>There is now an implicit conversion from direct
functoids to indirect functoids (<code>FunN</code>s).  For example,
<pre>
   Fun1&lt;int,int,int&gt; f          = fcpp::plus;
   Fun1&lt;double,double,double&gt; g = fcpp::plus;
</pre>
both "do the right thing".</li>

<li>A number of "holes" in the library have been filled in; now
practically all of the general functions/classes (like
<code>ptr_to_fun()</code>, <code>monomorphizeN()</code>,
<code>CurryableN</code>, etc.) work for all sets of functions with 0-3
arguments.  (Previous versions of FC++ had spotty support.)</li>

<li>This file: we plan to keep track of changes between versions from
now on, and put the changes in the distribution.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Changes (from v1.0 to v1.1)</h2>

<ul>

<li>The <code>List</code> class has been completely re-implemented.
The old version had a number of problems (the major ones being that (1)
it was too eager (not lazy enough) in a number of cases, and (2) that
functions like <code>cons</code> had un-intuitive interfaces) that have
now been solved.  In our limited tests, the new <code>List</code> seems
to perform comparably with the old, but let us know if you notice a
speed difference.</li>

<li><code>List::WrappedType</code> has been renamed to 
<code>List::ElementType</code>.  The new name makes more sense,
especially in papers/tutorials.</li>

<li>Header dependencies have been minimized; the library should only
suck in the headers it needs now, which means faster compile-times.</li>

<li>A number of minor bugs have been fixed throughout the library.</li>

<li>The function <code>list_until</code> has been renamed
<code>listUntil</code> (consistent with
naming convention of other list functions).</li>

</ul>
